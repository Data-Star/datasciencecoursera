#Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
#The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:
#Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
#Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
#Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
#Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
#Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
#Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
#Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
#Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
#Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
